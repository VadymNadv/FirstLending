  <H2>Poem</H1>
  <H3>MY TESTAMENT</H3>  
  
    <p1> 
        When I am dead, then bury me<br>
        In my beloved Ukraine,<br>
        My tomb upon a grave mound high<br>
        Amid the spreading plain,<br>
        So that the fields, the boundless steppes,<br> 
        The Dnieper’s plunging shore<br>
        My eyes could see, my ears could hear<br>
        The mighty river roar.<br>
        When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears<br>
        Into the deep blue sea<br>
        The blood of foes ... then will I leave<br>
        These hills and fertile fields -<br>
        I’ll leave them all and fly away<br>
        To the abode of God,<br> 
        And then I’ll pray .... But till that day<br> 
        I nothing know of God.<br>
        Oh bury me, then rise ye up<br>
        And break your heavy chains<br>
        And water with the tyrants1blood<br>
        The freedom you have gained.<br>
        And in the great new family,<br>
        The family of the free,<br>
        With softly spoken, kindly word<br>
        Remember also me.<br>
        </p1>
        <br>
        <p2>
            December 25, 1845 in Pereyaslav Translated by John Weir
